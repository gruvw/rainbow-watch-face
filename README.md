# ðŸŒˆ Rainbow Watch Face
<img align="right" alt="Watch Face GIF" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/gruvw/rainbow-watch-face/master/Gruvw_en_wf_packed_animated.gif" />

In this little side project I created my own smart watch design.  

It was designed to fit the [Xiaomi Mi Band 4](https://www.mi.com/global/mi-smart-band-4/).  

I published it on [AmazfitWatchFaces](https://amazfitwatchfaces.com/mi-band-4/view/3018).  

Fell free to try-it out yourself and tell me if you like it!
